EXPLANATION.

GEORGE, who is the author of the following poetical effu-
sions, is a Slave, the property of Mr. James Horton, of Chatham
County, North Carolina. He has been in the habit, some years
past, of producing poetical pieces, sometimes on suggested sub-
jects, to such persons as would write them while he dictated.
Several compositions of his have already appeared in the
Raleigh Register. Some have made their way into the Boston
newspapers, and have evoked expressions of approbation and
surprise. Many persons have now become much interested in
the promotion of his prospects, some of whom are elevated in
office and literary attainments, They are solicitous that efforts at

. length be made to obtain by subscription, a sum sufficient for
* his emancipation, upon the condition of his going in the vessel
which shall first afterwards sail for Liberia. It is his earnest
and only wish to become a member of that Colony, to enjoy its
privileges, and apply his industry and mental abilities to the
promotion of its prospects and his own. It is upon these terms
“alone, that the efforts of those who befriend his views are in-

  
   

t the plan here urged in his behalf, the paper
chibited is pu "" Seyeral of his productions are
contained in the. succeeding pages. Many more might have
been added, which would have swelled into a larger size.
They would doubtless be interesting to many, batit is hoped
that the specimens here inserted will be sufficient to accomplish
the object of the publication. Expense will thus be avoided,
and the money better employed in enlarging the sum applicable
for his emancipation.—It is proposed, that in every town or
vicinity where contributions are madey, they may be put into the
hands of some person, who will humanely consent to receive
‘them, and give notice to Mr. Weston R, Gales, in Raleigh, of ~
the amount collected. As soon as it is ascertained that the —
collections. will accomplish the object, it is expected that they
‘will be transmitted without delay to Mr. Weston A. Gales,
But should they ultimately prove insufficient, they will be re-
turned to subscribers.
None will imagine it possible that pieces produced as these
have been, should be free from blemish in composition or taste.
The author is now 32 years of age, and has always laboure hin

others which Mr. Horton owns, in circumstances of the greatest
possible simplicity. His master says he knew nothing of his
poetry, but as he heard of it from others. Grorer knows how
to read, and is now learning to write. All his pieces are written
down by others; and his reading, which is done at night, and at
the usual intervals allowed to slaves, has been much employed
on poetry, such as he could procure, this being the species of
composition most interesting to him. It is thought bestto print
his productions without correction, that the mind of the reader
may be in no uncertainty as to the originality and genuineness
of every part. We shall conclude this account of Groreer,
with an assurance that he has been ever a faithful, honest and
industrious slave. That his heart has felt deeply and sensitively
in this lowest possible condition of human nature, will easily be
believed, and is impressively confirmed by one of his stanzas,

Come, melting Pity, from afar,
And break this vast enormous bar
Between a wretch and thee ;
Purchase a few short days of time,
And bid a vassal soar sublime,
On wings of Liberty.
Raleigh, July 2, 1829. ‘

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

Of these poems, the present publisher has never seen or
heard of but one copy, which was recently obtained by Josuua
Corrin, of this city, from a gentleman who met with ee
cinnati afew years ago. The pamphlet is republished, w
out any alterations,—even verbal; except the insertion of the
headline, ‘* Poems by a slave,” over the pages, and the omis-
sion of the title page, which ran as follows:

“The Hope of Liberty, containing a number of poetical
pieces. By George M. Horton. Raleigh, printed by Gales &
Son, 1829.”

Observe Ist, That Gales, the printer of the pamphlet, is now
one of the firm of Gales & Seaton, at Washington,—no «aboli-
tionist. 2nd, The*publisher admits slavery to be ‘the lowest —
possible condition of human nature ;”’ and that the slaves are
not all happy, for George ‘‘felt deeply and sensitively.”’ 3d,
The man-who could write such poems-was kept for 32 years in
«the lowest possible condition of human nature,” and was to
remain there if he would not consent to go to Liberia.

ether the poems sold for sufficient to buy this man, so
dangerous to “Southern institutions,” and export him, I have

not been able to ascertain. Perhaps George is still a slave! :

PRAISE OF CREATION.

Creation fires my tongue!
Nature thy anthems raise ;
And spread the universal song
Of thy Creator’s praise !

Immediately after the present edition was issued, the follow-

ing letter was put into my hands. PuBLISHER.

Washington, September 12th, 1837.
Dear Sir:—I have inquired of Mr. Gales, agreeably to your
request to ‘ascertain the present condition of George M. Horton.
He informs me that he is still the slave of James Horton of
Chatham County, and is employed as a servant at Chapel Hill,
the seat of the University of North Carolina. It is understood
by Mr. G, that he did not derive much pecuniary profit from the
publication of his poems; and that, since the death of his pa-
tron, the late Dr. Caldwell, President of the University he has
attended to other occupations.
Jam,

Yours truly,
KEKE

Mr. Josuvua Corrin.

They seized their golden harps as soon
And touched on every string.

And fan Creation’s blaze,
And ye terrific lions roar,

PRAISE OF CREATION.

Creation fires my tongue!
Nature thy anthems raise ;
And spread the universal song
Of thy Creator’s praise !

Heaven’s chief delight was Man
Before Creation’s birth—

Ordained with joy to lead the van,
And reign the lord of earth.

When Sin was quite unknown,
And all the woes it brought,

He hailed the morn withont a groan
Or one corroding thought.

When each revolving wheel
Assumed its sphere sublime,
Submissive Earth then heard the peal,
And struck the march of time.

The march in Heaven begun,
And splendor filled the skies,
‘When Wisdom bade the morning Sun
With joy from chaos rise.

The angels heard the tune
Throughout creation ring ;
They seized their golden harps as soon
And touched on every string.

When time and space were young,
And music rolled along—

The morning stars together sung,
And Heaven was drown’d in song.

Ye towering eagles soar,
And fan Creation’s blaze,

And ye terrific lions roar, i
To your Creator’s praise. :

Responsive thunders roll,
Loud acclamations sound,

And show your Maker’s vast control
O’er all the worlds around.

Stupendous mountains smoke,
And lift your summits high,

To him who all your terrors woke,
Dark’ning the sapphire sky.

Now let my muse descend,
To view the march below—
Ye subterraneous worlds attend
And bid your chorus flow.

Ye vast volcanoes yell
Whence fiery cliffs are hurled;
And all ye liquid oceans swell
Beneath the solid world.

Ye cataracts combine,
Nor let the pean cease—
The universal concert join,
Thou dismal precipice.

But halt my feeble tongue,
My weary muse delays:

But, oh my soul, still float along
Upon the flood of praise!

ON THE SILENCE OF A YOUNG LADY,
On account of the imaginary flight of her suitor.

Oh, heartless dove ! mount in the skies,
Spread thy soft wing upon the gale,
Or on thy sacred pinions rise,
Nor brood with silence in the vale.

Breathe on the air thy plaintive note,
Which oft has filled the lonesome grove,
And let thy melting ditty float—
The dirge of long lamented love.

Coo softly to the silent ear,
And make the floods of grief to roll ;
And cause by love the sleeping tear,
To wake with sorrow from the soul.

Is it the loss of pleasures past

Which makes thee droop thy sounding wing ?
Does winter’s rough, inclement blast

Forbid thy tragic voice to sing ?

Is it because the fragrant breeze
Along the sky forbears to fllw—

Nor whispers low amidst the trees,
Whilst all the vallies frown below ?

Why should a frown thy soul alarm,
And tear thy pleasures from thy breast?
Or veil the siniles of every charm,
And rob thee of thy peacefu! rest.

Perhaps thy sleeping love may wake,
And hear thy penitential tone ;

And suffer not thy heart to break,
Nor let a princess grieve alone.

Perhaps his pity may return,
With equal feeling from the heart,
And breast with breast together burn,
Never—no, never more to part.

THE LOVER’S FAREWELL.

And wilt thou, love, my soul display,
And all my secret thoughts betray?
I strove, but could not hold thee fast,
My heart flies off with thee at last.

The favorite daughter of the dawn,

On love’s mild breeze will soon be gone;
I strove, but could not cease to love,
Nor from my heart the weight remove.

And wilt thou, love, my soul beguile,
And gull thy fav’rite with a smile?
Nay, soft affection answers, nay,

And beauty wings my heart away.

i steal on tiptoe from these bowers,
All spangled with a thousand flowers ;
I sigh, yet leave them all behind,

To gain the object of my mind.

And wilt thou, love, command my soul,
And waft me with a light control ?—
Adieu to all the blooms of May,
Farewell—I fly with love away!

I leave my parents here behind,

And all my friends—to love resigned—
*Tis grief to go, but death to stay :
Farewell—I’m gone with love away!

ON LIBERTY AND SLAVERY.

Alas! and am I born for this,
To wear this slavish chain ?
Deprived of all created bliss,
Through hardship, toil and pain !

How long have | in bondage lain,
And languished to be free !

Alas ! and must I still complain—
Deprived of liberty.

Oh, Heaven ! and is there no relief
This side the silent grave—

To soothe the pain—to quell the grief
And anguish of a slave ?

Come Liberty, thou cheerful sound,
Roll through my ravished ears !

Come, let my grief in joys be drowned,
And drive away my fears.

Say unto foul oppression, Cease :
Ye tyrants rage no more,

And let the joyful trump of peace,
Now bid the vassal soar.

Soar on the pinions of that dove
Which long has cooed for thee,

And breathed her notes from Afric’s grove,
The sound of Liberty.

Oh, Liberty ! thou golden prize,
So often sought by blood—
We crave thy sacred sun to rise,

The gift of nature’s God!

Bid Slavery hide her haggard face,
And barbarism fly :

I scorn to see the sad disgrace
In which enslaved I lie.

Dear Liberty ! upon thy breast,

And like the Swan unto her nest,

ON THE DEATH OF AN INFANT.

Blest Babe! it at length has withdrawn,
The Seraphs have rocked it to sleep ;

Away with an angelic smile it has gone,
And left a sad parent to weep !

It soars from the ocean of pain,
On breezes of precious perfume ;

O be not discouraged when death is but gain—
The triumph of life from the tomb.

With pleasure I thought it my own,
And smil’d on its infantile charms ;

But some mystic bird, like an eagle, came down,
And snatch’d it away from my arms.

Blest Babe, it ascends into Heaven,
It mounts with delight at the call ;

And flies to the bosom from whence it was given,
The Parent and Patron of all.

And withhold her cheering beam?
Rather let me sleep and dream

For ever !

Something still my heart surveys,

Groping through this dreary maze 5

Is it Hope 1—then burn and blaze
For ever!

Leave me not a wretch confined,

Altogether Jame and blind—

Unto gross despair consigned,
For ever!

Heaven! in whom can I confide?
Canst thou not for all provide?
Condescend to be my guide

And when this transient life shall end,
Oh, may some kind, eternal friend
Bid me from servitude ascend,

For ever!

E’en John the Baptist did not know
Who Christ the Lord could be,
And bade his own disciples go,
The strange event to see.

They said, Art thou the one of whom
*T was written long before ?

Is there another still to come,
Who will all things restore ?

This is enough, without a name—
Go, tell him what is done;

Behold the feeble, weak and lame,
With strength rise up and run.

This is enough—the blind now see,
The dumb Hosannas sing ;

Devils far from his presence flee,
As shades from morning’s wing.

Prostrate before him fall ;

Immanuel speaks, and Lazarus hears—
The dead obeys his call.

And withers at his frown ;

And drop her flowery crown,

At his command the fish increase,
And loaves of barley swell—

Ye hungry eat, and hold your peace,
And find a remnant still.

At his command the water blushed,
And all was turned to wine,

And in redundance flowed afresh,
And owned its God divine.

Behold the storms at his rebuke,
All calm upon the sea—

How can we for another look,
When none can work as he?

And thus salute the fragrant skies

And send a gale of sweet perfume,

The male of birds escorts his bride,
And twitters on the spray ;

To hail the bounty of the Spring,

How oft we in the peaceful grove,
Survey the flowery plume;

Or sit beneath the sylvan shade,

Where branches wave above the head,
And smile on every bloom.

May Virtue then begin the dawn
Of an eternal Spring ?
May raptures kindle on my tongue,
And start a new, eternal song,
Which ne’er shall cease to ring!

ON SUMMER.

Esteville fire begins to burn;

The auburn fields of harvest rise ;
The torrid flames again return,

And thunders roll along the skies.

Perspiring Cancer lifts his head,
And roars terrific from on high ;

Whose voice the timid creatures dread,
From which they strive with awe to fly.

The night-hawk ventures from his cell,
And starts his note in evening air;

He feels the heat his bosom swell,
Which drives away the gloom of fear.

Thou noisy insect, start thy drum;

Rise lamp-like bugs to light the train;
And bid sweet Philomela come,

And sound in front the nightly strain,

The bee begins her ceaseless hum,
And doth with sweet exertions rise;

And with delight she stores her comb,
And well her rising stock supplies.

Let sportive children well beware,

While sprightly frisking o’er the green;
And carefully avoid the snare,

Which lurks beneath the smiling scene,

The mistress bird assumes her nest,
And broods in silence on the tree,

Her note to cease, her wings at rest,
She patient waits her young to see.

The farmer hastens from the heat;

The weary plough-horse droops his head;
The cattle all at noon retreat,

And ruminate beneath the shade.

The burdened ox with dauntless rage,
Flies heedless to the liquid flood,

From which he quaffs, devoid of guage,
Regardless of his driver’s rod,

Pomaceous orchards now expand
Their laden branches o’er the lea ;

And with their bounty fill the land,
While plenty smiles on every tree.

On fertile borders, near the stream,
Now gaze with pleasure and delight;

See loaded vines with melons teem—

ON WINTER.

When smiling Summer’s charms are past,
The voice of music dies;

Then Winter pours his chilling blast
From rough inclement skies.

The pensive dove shuts up her throat,
The larks forbear to soar,

Or raise one sweet, delightful note,
Which charm’d the ear before.

The screech-owl peals her shivering tone
Upon the brink of night;
As some sequestered child unknown,
Which feared to come in sight.

The cattle all desert the field,
And eager seek the glades

Of naked trees, which once did yield
Their sweet and pleasant shades.

The humming insects all are still,
The beetles rise no more,

The constant tinkling of the bell,
Along the heath is o’er.

Stern Boreas hurls each piercing gale
With snow-clad wings along,

Discharging volleys mixed with hail
Which chill the breeze of song.

Lo, all the Southern windows close,
Whence spicy breezes roll ;

The herbage sinks in sad repose,
And Winter sweeps the whole.

Thus after youth old age comes on,
And brings the frost of time,

And e’er our vigour has withdrawn,
We shed the rose of prime.

Alas! how quick it is the case,
The scion youth is grown—

How soon it runs its morning race,
And beauty’s sun goes down.

The Autumn of declining years
Must blanch the father’s head,
Encumbered with a load of cares,
When youthful charms have fled.

HEAVENLY LOVE. \

Eternal spring of boundless grace,
It lifts the soul above,

Where God the Son unveils his face,
And shows that Heaven is love.

Love that revolves through endless years—
Love that can never pall;

Love which excludes the gloom of fears,
Love to whom God is all!

Love which can ransom every slave,
And set the pris’ner free ;

Gild the dark horrors of the grave,
And still the raging sea.

Let but the partial smile of Heaven
Upon the bosom play,

The mystic sound of sins forgiven,
Can waft the soul away.

The pilgrim’s spirits show this love,
They often soar on high;

Languish from this dim earth to move,
And leave the flesh to die.

Thou delicate blossom! thy short race is ended,
Thou sample of virtue and prize of the brave!
No more are thy beauties by mortals attended,
They now are but food for the worms and the grave.

Thou art gone to the tomb, whence there’s no returning,
And left us behind in a vale of suspense ;

In vain to the dust do we follow thee mourning,
The same doleful tramp will soon call us all hence.

I view thee now launched on eternity’s o
Thy soul how it smiles as it floats on the wave;

Oh, death is a song to the poor ransom’d slave;

Rebecca is free from the pains of oppression,

No friends could prevail with her longer to stay ;
She smiles on the fields of eternal fruition,

Whilst death like a bridegroom attends her away.

She is gone in the whirlwind—ye seraphs attend her,
Through Jordan’s cold torrent her mantle may lave ;

She soars in the chariot, and earth falls beneath her,
Resign’d in a shroud to a peaceable grave.

ON DEATH.

Deceitful worm, that undermines the clay,
Which slyly steals the thoughtless soul, away,
Pervading neighborhoods with sad surprise,
Like sudden storms of wind and thunder rise.

The sounding death-watch lurks within the wall,
Away some unsuspecting soul to call;

The pendant willow droops her waving head,
And sighing zephyrs whisper of the dead.

ethinks J hear the doleful midnight knell—
me parting spirit bids the world farewell;
The taper burns as conscious of distress,
And seems to show the living number less.

Must a lov’d daughter from her father part,
And grieve for one who lies so near her heart?
And must she for the fatal Joss bemoan,

Or faint to hear his last departing groan.

Methinks I see him speechless gaze awhile,
And on her dr is ] paternal smile;
With gushing tears closing his humid eyes,
The last pulse beats, and in her arms he dies.

With pallid cheeks she lingers round his bier,
And heaves a farewell sigh with every tear;
With sorrow she consigns him to the dust,
And silent owns the fatal sentence just.

Still her sequestered mother seems to weep,
And spurns the balm which constitutes her sleep;
Her plaintive murmurs float upon the gale,

And almost make the stubborn rocks bewail.

O what is like the awful breach of death,

Whose fatal stroke invades the creature’s breath!

It bids the voice of desolation roll,

And strikes the deepest awe within the bravest soul.

Sing, oh my soul, rise up and run,
And leave this clay behind;
Wing thy swift flight beyond the sun,
Nor dwell in tents confined.

ON THE DEATH OF REBECCA.

Thou delicate blossom! thy short race is ended,
Thou sample of virtue and prize of the brave!
No more are thy beauties by mortals attended,
They now are but food for the worms and the grave.

Than art gone to the tomb, whence there’s no returning,
And left us behind in a vale of suspense ;

In vain to the dust do we follow thee mourning,
The same doleful trump will soon call us all hence.

I view thee now launched on eternity’s ocean,
Thy soul how it smiles as it floats on the wave;
It smiles as if filled with the softest emotion,
But looks not behind on the frowns of the grave.

The messenger came from afar to relieve thee—
In this lonesome valley no more shalt thou roam ;
Bright seraphs now stand on the banks to receive thee,
And ery, ‘Happy stranger, thou art welcome at home.””
Thou art gone to a feast, while thy friends are bewailing,
Oh, death is a song to the poor ransom’d slave ;
Away with bright visions the spirit goes sailing,
And leaves the frail body to rest in the grave.

Rebecca is free from the pains of oppression,

No friends could prevail with her longer to stay ;
She smiles on the fields of eternal fruition,

Whilst death like a bridegroom attends her away.

She is gone in the whirlwind—ye seraphs attend her,
Through Jordan’s cold torrent her mantle may lave ;

She soars in the chariot, and earth falls beneath her,
Resign’d in a shroud to a peaceable grave.

ON THE EVENING AND MORNING.

When Evening bids the Sun to rest retire,
Unwearied Ether sets her lamps on fire ;
Lit by one torch, each is supplied in turn,
Till all the candles in the concave burn.

The night-hawk now, with his nocturnal tone,
Wakes up, and all the Owls begin to moan,
Or heave from dreary vales their dismal song,
Whilst in the air the meteors play along.

At length the silver queen begins to rise,
And spread her glowing mantle in the skies,
And from the smiling chambers of the east,
Invites the eye to her resplendent feast.

What joy is this unto the rustic swain,

Who from the mount surveys the moon-lit plain ;
Wro with the spirit of a dauntless Pan
Controls his fleecy train and leads the van;

Or pensive, muses on the water’s side,

Which purling doth thro’ green meanders glide,
With watchful care he broods his heart away
Till night is swallowed in the flood of day.

The meteors cease to play, that mov’d so fleet

And spectres from the murky groves retreat,

The prowling wolf withdraws, which howl’d so bold
And bleating flocks may venture from the fold.

The night-hawk’s din deserts the shepherd’s ear,
Succeeded by the huntsman’s trumpet clear,

O come Diana, start the morning chase

Thou ancient goddess of the hunting race.

Aurora’s smiles adorn the mountain’s brow,
The peasant hums delighted at his plough,
And lo, the dairy maid salutes her bounteous cow.

ON THE POETIC MUSE.

Far, far above this world I soar,
And almost nature lose,
Aerial regions to explore,
With this ambitious Muse.

My towering thoughts with pinions rise,
Upon the gales of song,

Which waft me through the mental skies,
With music on my tongue,

My Muse is all on mystic fire,
Which kindles in my breast;

To scenes remote she doth aspire,
As never yet exprest,

Wrapt in the dust she scorns to lie,
Call’d by new charms away ;

Nor will she e’er refuse to try
Such wonders to survey.

Such is the quiet bliss of soul,
When in some calm retreat,

Where pensive thoughts like streamlets roll,
And render silence sweet ;

And when the vain tumultuous crowd
Shakes comfort from my mind,

My muse ascends above the cloud
And leaves the noise behind.

With vivid flight she mounts on high
Above the dusky maze,

And with a perspicacious eye
Doth far ’bove nature gaze,

CONSEQUENCES OF HAPPY MARRIAGES.

Hail happy pair, from whom such raptures rise,
On whom I gaze with pleasure and surprise ;
From thy bright rays the gloom of strife is driven,
For all the smiles of mutual love are Heaven.

Thrice happy pair! no earthly joys excel °

Thy peaceful state; there constant pleasures dwell,
Which cheer the mind and elevate the soul,

Whilst discord sinks beneath their soft control.

The blaze of zeal extends from breast to breast,
While Heaven supplies each innocent request;
And lo! what fond regard their smiles reveal,
Attractive as the magnet to the steel.

Their peaceful life is all content and ease,
They with delight each other strive to please ;
Each other’s charms, they only can admire,
Whose bosoms burn with pure connubial fire.

Th’ indelible vestige of unblemished love,
Must hence a guide to generations prove :
Though virtuous partners moulder in the tomb,
Their light may shine on ages yet to come.

With grateful tears their well-spent day shall close,
When death, like evening, calls them to repose ;
Then mystic smiles may break from deep disguise,
Like Vesper’s torch transpiring in the skies.

Like constellations still their works may shine,
In virtue’s unextinguished blaze divine ;

Happy are they whose race shal] end the same—
Sweeter than odours is a virtuous name.

Such is the transcript of unfading grace,
Reflecting lustre on a future race,

The virtuous on this line delight to tread,
And magnify the honors of the dead—

Who like a Pheenix did not burn in vain,
Incinerated to revive again ;

From whose exalted urn young love shall rise,
Exulting from a funeral sacrifice.

LINES,
On hearing of the intention of a gentleman to purchase
the Poet’s freedom.

When on life’s ocean first I spread my sail,

I then implored a mild auspicious gale; _
And from the slippery strand I took my flight,
And sought the peaceful haven of delight.

Tyrannic storms arose upon my soul,

And dreadful did their mad’ning thunders roll ;
The pensive muse was shaken from her sphere,
And hope, it vanish’d in the clouds of fear.

At length a golden sun broke through the gloom,
And from his smiles arose a sweet perfume—

A calm ensued, and birds began o sing,

And lo! the sacred muse resumed her wing.

With frantic joy she chaunted as she flew,

And kiss’d the clement hand that bore her through ;
Her envious foes did from her sight retreat,

Or prostrate fall beneath her burning feet.

*T was like a proselyte, allied to Heaven—

Or rising spirits’ boast of sins forgiven,
Whose shout dissolves the adamant away,
Whose melting voice the stubborn rocks obey.

’T was like the salutation of the dove,

Borne on the zephyr through some lonesome grove,
‘When Spring returns, and Winter’s chill is past,
And vegetation smiles above the blast.

Twas like the evening of a nuptial pair,

When love pervades the hour of sad despair—
°’T was like fair Helen’s sweet return to Troy,
‘When every Grecian bosom swell’d with joy.

The silent harp which on the osiers hung,
‘Was then attuned, and manumission sung :
Away by hope the clouds of fear were driven,
And music breathed my gratitude to Heaven.

Hard was the race to reach the distant goal,
The needle oft was shaken from the pole;

In such distress who could forbear to weep ?
Toss’d by the headlong billows of the deep !

The tantalizing beams which shone s0 plain,
Which turned my former pleasures into pain—
Which falsely promised all the joys of fame,
Gave way, and to a more substantial flame.

Some philanthropic souls as from afar,
With pity strove to break the slavish bar;
To whom my floods of gratitude shall roll,
And yield with pleasure to their soft control.

And sure of Providence this work begun—
He shod my feet this rugged race to run;
And in despite of all the swelling tide,
Along the dismal path will prove my guide.

Thus on the dusky verge of deep despair,

Eternal Providence was with me there ;

When pleasure seemed to fade on life’s gay dawn,
And the last beam of hope was almost gone.

TO THE GAD-FLY.

Majestic insect! from thy royal hum,

The flies retreat, or starve before they’ll come;
The obedient plough-horse may, devoid of fear,
Perform his task with joy, when thou art near.

As at the Lion’s dread alarming roar,

The inferior beasts will never wander more,
Lest unawares he should be seized away,
And to the prowling monster fall a prey.

With silent pleasure often do I trace
The fly upon the wing, with rapid pace,
The fugitive proclaims upon the wind,
The death-bound sheriff is not far behind.

Ye thirsty flies beware, nor dare approach,
Nor on the toiling animal encroach ;

Be vigilant, before you buzz too late,

The victim of a melancholy fate.

Such seems the caution of the once chased fly,
Whilst to the horse she dare not venture nigh;
This useful Gad-Fly traversing the field,
With care the lab’ring animal to shield.

Such is the eye of Providential care,

Along the path of life forever there;

Whose guardian hand by day doth mortals keep
And gently lays them down at night to sleep.

Immortal Guard, shall I thy pleasures grieve
Like Noah’s dove, wilt thou the creature leave;
No never, never, whilst on earth I stay,

And after death, then fly with me away.

THE LOSS OF FEMALE CHARACTER.

See that fallen Princess! her splendor is gone—
The pomp of her morning is over;

Her day-star of pleasure refuses to dawn,

She wanders a nocturnal rover.

Alas! she resembles Jerusalem’s fall,

The fate of that wonderful city ;

When grief with astonishment rung from the wall,
Instead of the heart cheering ditty.

When music was silent, no more to be rung,

When Sion wept over her daughter ;

On grief’s drooping willow their harps they were hung,
When pendent o’er Babylon’s water.

She looks like some Star that has fall’n from her sphere,
No more by her cluster surrounded 5

Her comrades of pleasure refuse her to cheer,

And leave her dethron’d and confounded.

She looks like some Queen who has boasted in vain,
Whose diamond refuses to glitter ;

Deserted by those who once bow’d in her train,
Whose flight to her soul must be bitter.

She looks like the twilight, her sun sunk away,

He sets; but to rise again never !

Like the Eve, with a blush bids farewell to the day,
And darkness conceals her forever.

LIFE OF
GHORGE Mo HORDON,
“The Colored Bard of North-Carolina.

 

F Rom the importunate request of a few
individuals, I assume the difficult task, of
writing a concise history of my life. But to
open a scene of all the past occurrences of my
life 1 shall not undertake, sinee I should fail
by more than two-thirds in the matter. But
if you will condescend to read it, I will endea-
vor to give a slight specimen entirely clear of
exaggeration. A tedious and prolix detail in
the matter may not be of any expected, since
there is necessarily so much particularity 1e-
quired in a biographical narrative.

I was born in Northampton county, N C.,°
near the line of Virginia, and within four miles
of the Roanoke River; the property of Wil-
liam Horton, senior, who also owned my _
mother, and the whole stock of her children,
which were five before me, all girls, but not of
one father. I am the oldest child that my-
mother had by her second husband, and she had

four younger than myself, one boy and three
girls. But to account for my age is beyond
the reach of my power. I was early fond of
music, with an extraordinary appetite for sing-
ing lively times, for which I was a little re-
markable. In the course of a few years after
my birth, from the sterility of his land, my old
master assumed the notion to move into Chat-
ham, a more fertile and fresh part of country
recently settled, and whose waters were far
more healthy and agreeable. I here become
a cow-boy, which I followed for perhaps ten
years in succession, or more. In the course
of this disagreeable occupation, I became fond
‘of hearing people read; but bemg nothing but
a poor cow-boy, | had but little or no thought
of ever being able to read or spell one word
or sentence in any book whatever. My moth-
erdiscovered my anxiety for books, and strove
to encourage my plan; but she, having left her
husband behind, was so hard run to make a
little shift for herself, that she could give me
no assistance in that case. At length I took
a resolution to learn the alphabet at all events;.
and lighting by chance at times with some
_ opportunities of being in the presence of
school children, I learnt the letters by heart;
and fortunately afterwards got hold of some
",https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/hortonpoem/hortonpoem.html
The poetical works of George M. Horton,poeticalworksofg00hort_0009.jpg,9,Book,,"v

eld parts of spelling books abounding with
these elements, which I learnt with but little
difficulty. And by this time, my brother was
‘deeply excited by the assiduity which he dis-
covered in me, to learn himself; and some of
his partial friends strove to put him before me,
and I ina stump now, and a sorry instrument
to work with at that. But still my~ brother
never could keep time with me.. He was in-
deed an ostentatious youth, and of a far more
attractive person than myself, more forward
in manly show, and early became fond of po~
pularity to an astonishing degree for one of
his age and capacity. He strove hard on
the wing of ambition to soar above me, and
could write a respectable fist before I could
form the first letter with a pen, or barely knew
the use of a goose-quill. And I mustsay that
he was: quite a remarkable youth, as studious
as a judge, but much too full of vain loung-
ing among the fair sex.

But to return to the earlier spring of my
progress. ‘Though blundering, I became a
far better reader than he; but we were indeed
both remarkable for boys of color, and hard
raising, On well nigh every Sabbath during
the year, did I retire away in the summer sea-

: e
gon to some shady and lonely recess, when

could stammer over the dim and promiscuoué
syllables in my old black and tattered spelling
book, sometimes a piece of one, and then of
another; nor would I scarcely spare the time
to return to my ordinary meals, being so tru-
ly engaged with my book. And by close appli-
cation to my book at night, my visage became
considerally emaciated by extreme perspira-
tion, having no lucubratory aparatus, no can-
dle, no lamp, nor even light-wood, being
chiefly raised in oaky woods. Hence I had
to sit sweating and smoking over my incom-
petent bark or brush light, almost exhausted
by the heat of the fire, and almost suffocated
with smoke; consequently from Monday
morning I anticipated with joy the approach
of the next Sabbath, that I might again retire
to the pleasant umbrage of the woods, whith-
er I was used to dwell or spend the most of
the day with ceaseless investigation over my
book. A number strove to dissuade me from
my plan, and had the presumption to tell
me that I was a vain fool to attempt learning
to read with as little chance as I had. Play
boys importunately insisted on my ‘abandon-
ing my foolish theory, and go with them on
streams, desport, and sacrifice the day, in athe
leti¢ folly, or alibatic levity. Nevertheless

did I persevere with an indefatigable resolu-
tion, at the risk of success. But ah! the op-
positions with which I contended are too te-
dious to relate, but not too formidable to sur-
mount; and I verily believe that those obsta-
cles had an auspicious tendency to waft me,
as on pacific gales, above the storms of envy
and the calumniating scourge of emulation,
from which literary imagination often sinks
beneath its dignity, and instruction languishes
at the shrine of vanity. 1 reached the threa-
tening heights of literature, and braved in a
manner the clouds of disgust which reared in
thunders under my feet. This brings to mind
the verse of an author on the adventurous
seaman.

«The wandering sailor ploughs the main,
A competence in life to gain;

The threatening waves around him foam,
Till flattering fancy wafts him home.’”

For the overthrow and downfal of my scheme
had been repeatedly threatened. But with

defiance I accomplished the arduous task of

spelling, (for thus it was with me,) having no
facilitating assistance. From this I entered
into reading lessons with triumph. Ibecame
very fond of reading parts of the New Testa-

tment, such as [ could pick up as they lay
about at random; but I soon became more
fond of reading verses, Wesley’s old hymns,
and other peices of poetry from various au-
thors. 1 became found of it to that degree,
that whenever I chanced to light on a piece of
paper, so common to be lying about, I would
pick it up in order to examine it whether it
was written in that curious style or not. If
it was not, unless some remarkable prose, I
threw it aside; and if it was, Eas carefully pre-
served it as 1 would a piece of morey. At
fength I began to wonder whether it was pos-
sible that I ever could be so fortunate as to
compose in that manner. I fell to work in
my head, and composed several undigested
pieces, which I retained in my mind, for I
knew nothing about writing with a pen, also
without the least grammatical knowledge, a
few lines of which I yet retain. I will give
you the following specimen. On one very
calm Sabbath morning, a while before the
time of preaching, I undertook to compose a
divine hymn, being under some serious im-
pression of mind:
Rise up, my soul, and let us go
Up to the gospel feast;

To join and be a guest.

Dost thou not hear the trumpet call
For thee; my soul, for thee?

Not only thee, my soul, but all,
May tise and enter free.

The other part I cannot now recollect. But
in the course of some eight or ten months,
under similar pensive impressions, I compos-
ed the following:

Excited from reading the obedience of Nature to her
Lord in the vessel on the sea.

Master, we perish if thou sleep,

We know not whence to fly;

Death frowns from all the sky.

He said, ye seas, be still;

Whilst riding on the wind,

My power restrains the thunder’s arm,
Which dies in chains confined.

After having read the travel of Israel from
Egypt to the Red Red Sea, where they tri-
umphantly arrive on the opposite bank, I
was excited to compose the following few
lines : I

Sing, O ye ransom’d, shout and tell .
« What God has done for ye;

The horses and their riders fell

* And perish’d in the sea.

Look back, the vain Egyptian dies
Whilst plunging from the shore;
He groans, he sinks, but not to rise,

King Pharaoh is no more.

Many other pieces did I compose, which
have long since slipped my recollection, and
some perhaps better than those before you.
During this mental conflict no person was ap-
prised of my views except my brother, who
rather surmised it, being often in converse
with me, and who was equally emulous for
literature, and strove to rival me. Though

he learnt to read very well for one of color,
it seems that his genius did not direct him
‘towards Parnassus, for he was rather a Jo-
sephus than a Homer; though he could write
very well before I could form the first letter
as above stated, for I devoted most of my op-
portunities to the study of composing or try-
ing to compose, At any critical juncture,
when any thing momentous transpired, such
as death, misfortune, disappointment, and the
like, it generally passed off from my mind
liké the chanting of birds after a storm, for
my mind was then more deeply inspired than
at other periods. ;

One thing is to be lamented much; that is;
that ever I was raised ina family or neigh-
borheod inclined to dissipation, or that the
foul seed should have been sown in the bosom
of youth, to stifle the growth of uncultivated
genius, which like a torch lifted from a cell
in the midst of rude inclement winds, which,
instead of kindling its blaze, blows it out. My
old master, being an eminent farmer, who had
acquired a competent stock of living through
his own prudence and industry, did not de-
scend to the particularity of schooling his
children at any high rate; hence it is clear that
he cared less for the improvement of the mind

of his servants, In fact, he was a man who
aspired to a great deal of elaborate business,
and carried me into measures almost beyond
my physical ability. Often has he ealled me
with my fellow laborers to his door to get the
ordinary dram, of which he was much too
fond himself; and we, willing to copy the.ex-
ample, partook freely in order to brave the
storms of hardship, and thought it an honor
to be intoxicated. And it was then the case
with the most of people; for they were like
savages, who think little or nothing of the re-
sult of lewd conduct. Nay, in those days,
when the stream of intemperance was little
regarded, the living had rather poura libation
on the bier of the dead than to heara solemn
funeral preached from the hallowed lips of a
divine; for Bacchus was honored far more
than Ceres, and they would rather impair the
fences of fertile lands in their inebriating
course, than to assist a prudent farmer in cul-
tivating a field for the space of an hour,

Those days resembled the days of martyr-
dom, and all christendom seemed to be relaps-
ing into dissipation; and libertinism, obsceni-
ty and profanation were in their full career;

and the common conversation was impregnat-

ed with droll blasphemy. In those days sen-_

sual gratification was prohibited by few; for
drinking, I had almost said, was a catholic to- ,
leration, and from 1800. to 1810 there was
scarcely a page of exemplary conduct laid be-
fore my eyes. Hence it was inevitably my
misfortune to become a votary to that growing,
evil; and like a Saul, I was almost ready to
hold the garments of an abominable rabble in
their public sacrilege, io whom the tender of
a book was offensive, especially to those who
followed distilling on the Sabbath in the midst
of acrowd of profligate sots, gambling around,
regardless of demon, or Deity! Such scenes
T have witnessed with my own eyes, when
nota sunday school was:planted in all the sur-
rounding vicinities.

My old master having come to the conclu-
sion to confer part of his servants on his child-
ren, lots were cast, and his son James fell
heir tome. He was then living on North-
ampton, in the winter of 1814. In 1815 he
moved into Chatham, when my opportunities
became a little expanded. Having got in the
way of carrying fruit to the college at Chapel
Hill on the Sabbath, the collegians who, for
their diversion, were fond of pranking with
the country servants who resorted there for
the'same purpose that I did, began also to

prank with me. But some how or other
they discovered a spark of genius in me, eith-
er by discourse or other means, which excit-
ed their curiosity, and they often eagerly in-
sisted on me to spout, as they called it. . This
inspired in me a kind of enthusiastic pride.
I was indeed too full of vain egotism, which
always discovers the gloom of ignorance, or
dims the lustre of popular distinction. I
would stand forth and address myself extem-
pore before them, ‘as an orator of inspired
promptitude. But I soon found it an object
of aversion, and considered myself nothing
but a public ignoramus. Hence I abandoned
my foolish harangues, and began to speak of
poetry, which lifted them still higher on the
wing of astonishment; all eyes were on me,
and all ears were open. Many were at first
incredulous; but the experiment of acrosties
establishedit as an incontestable fact. _Hence
my fame soon circulated like a stream through-
out the college. Many of these acrosties I
composed at the handle of the plough, and
retained them in my head, (being unable to
write,) until an opportunity offered, when I
dictated, whilst one of the gentlemen would
‘serve as my emanuensis. I have composed
love pieces in verse for courtiers from all parts

ny of the tip top belles of Virginia, South Ca-
rolina and Georgia. But those criticising
gentlemen saw plainly what I lacked, and ma-
ny of them very generously gave me such
books as they considered useful in my case,
which I received with much gratitude, and
improved according to my limited opportuni-
ties. Among these gentlemen the following

names occur to me: Mr. Robert Gilliam, Mr.
Augustus Washington, Mr. Cornelius Rober-
son, Mr. Augustus Alston, Mr. Benjamin

Mr. Augustus Moore, Mr. ‘Thomas Pipkin,
Mr. A. Rencher, Mr. Ellerbee, Mr. Gilmer,
Mr. William Pickett, Mr. Leonidas Polk,
Mr. Samuel Hinton, Mr. Pain, Mr. Steward,
Mr, Gatlin, Mr. J. Hogan, Mr. John Pew,
Messrs W. and J. Haywood, and several
more whose names haye slipped my’ memo-
ry; all‘of whom were equally liberal to me,
and to them I ascribe my lean grammatical
studies. “Among the books given me were
Murray’s English Grammar and _ its accord-
ant branches; Johnson’s Dictionary in minia-
ture, and also Walker’s and Sheridan’s, and
parts of others. And other books of use they
gave me, which I had no chance to peruse

minutely. Milton’s Paradise Lost, Thompr
son’s Seasons, parts of Homer’s Illiad and
Virgil’s /Enead, Beauties of Shakespear,
Beauties of Byron, part of Plutarch, Morse’s
Geography, the Columbian Orator, Snow-
den’s History of the Revolution, Young’s _
Night Thoughts, and some others, which my
concentration of business did not suffer me to
pursue with any scientific regularity.

Mr. Augustus Alston first laid (as he said)
the low price of twenty-five cents on my com-
positions each, which was unanimously es-
tablished, and has been kept up ever since;
but some gentlemen extremely generous, have
given me from fifty to seventy-five cents, be-
sides many decent and repectable suits of
clothes, professing that they would not suffer
me to pass otherwise and write for them.

But there is one thing with which I am
sorry to charge many of these gentlemen,
Before the moral evil of excessive drinking
had been impressed upon my mind, they flat
tered me into the belief that it would hang me
on the wings of new inspiration, which would
waft me into regions of poetical perfection.
And Iam nota little astonished that nature and
reason had not taught me better before, after
having walked so long on a line which plain-

ly dictated and read to me, though young, the
lesson of human destruction. This realizes
the truth of the sentiment in the address of
the Earl of Chatham, in which he spoke of
“‘the wretch who, after having seen the diffi-
culties of a thousand errors, continues still
to blunder ;”’ ‘and I have now experienced
the destructive consequences of walking in
such a devious line from the true centre to
which I was so early attracted by the magnet
of genius. But I have discovered the bene-
ficial effects of temperance and regularity,
and fly as a penitent suppliant to the cell of
private reflection, sorrowing that I ever had
driven my boat of life so near the wrecking
shoals of death, or that I was allured by the
music of sirens that sing to ensnare the lovers
of vanity.

To the much distinguished Mrs. Hentz of
Boston, I owe much for the correction of ma-
ny poetical errors. Being a professional po-
etess herself, and a lover of genius, she disco-
vered my little uncultivated talent, and was
moved by pity to uncover to me the beauties
of correctness, together with the true impor-
tance of the object 1o which I aspired. She
was extremely pleased with the dirge which

primogenial infant, and for which she gave mé
much credit and a handsome reward. Not
being able to write myself, I dictated while she
wrote; and while thus engaged she strove in
vain to avert the inevitable tear slow trickling
down her ringlet-shaded cheek. She wasin-
deed unequivocally anxious to announce the
birth of my recent and astonishing fame, and
sent its blast on the gale of passage back to
the frozen plains of Massachusetts. .

This celebrated lady, however, did not eon-
tinue long at Chapel Hill, and I had to regret
the loss of her aid, which I shall never forget
in life. At her depatture from Chapel Hill,
she left behind her the laurel of Thalia bloom-
ing on my saind, and went with all the spot-
less gaiety of Euplizosyne with regard to the
signal services whieh she had done me. In
gratitude for all these favors, by whlch she
attempted to supply and augment the stock
of servile genius, I inscribe to her the fol-
lowing

EULOGY.

Deep on thy pillar, thou immortal dame,
Trace the inscription of eternal fame;
For. bards iinborm must yet thy works adore,

And bid thee live when others are no more.
When other names are lost among the dead,
Some genius yet may live thy fame to spread;
Memory’s fair bush shall not decline to bloom,
But flourish fresh upon thy sacred tomb.
When nature’s crown refuses to be gay,
And ceaseless streams have worn their rocks
away;
When age’s vail shall beauty’s visage mask,
And bid oblivion blot the poet’s task,
Time’s final shock shall elevate thy name,
And lift thee smiling to eternal fame.

I now commit my brief and blundering task
to the inspection of the public, not pretending
to warrant its philology nor its orthography,
since grammarians, through criterions them-
selves, from precipitation do not always es-
cape impropricties ; and which little task, as
before observed, I should not have assumed
had it not been insisted on by some parti-
cular gentlemen, for I did not consider my-
self capable of such an undertaking. I trust,
therefore, that my readers will rather pity
than abuse the essay of their unqualified
writer.

I will conclude with the following lines
from the memorable pen of Mr. Linn, in

The author of the following miscellane-
ous effusions, asserts that they are original,
and recently written; and they are now pre-
sented to the test of criticism, whatever may
be the result. It is entirely different from
his other work entitled the Museum, and has
been written some time since that, and is not
solarge. The author is far from flattering
himself with an idea of superiority, or even
equality with ancient or other modern poets.
He is deeply conscious of his own inferiority
from the narrowness of the scope in which he
has lived during the course of his past life.
Few men of either a white or colored popula-
tion, have been less prompted by a desire for
public fame than he whose productions are
now before you. He was actuated merely
by pleasure and curiosity, as a call to some
literary task, or as an example to remove the
doubts of cavilists with regard to African ge-
gius. His birth was low, and in a neigh-
borhood by no means populous; his raising

was rude and laborious; his exertions were
cramped, and his progress obstructed from
start to goal; having been ever deprived of the
‘free use of books and other advantages to
which he aspired. Hence his-genius is but
an unpolished diamond, and can never shine
forth to the world.

Forbid to make the least attempt to soar,

The stifled blaze of genius burns the more;

He still prevails his drooping head to raise,

Plods through the bogs, and on the moun-
tains gaze.

Whilst I these my pleasures display,
Resort to my musical chamber,
The laurel crown’d desert in May.

Resort to this chamber at leisure,
Attend it by night and by day;
To feast on the dainties of pleasure,

Which cannot be stinted in May.

This place is both pleasing and moral,
A chamber both lovely and gay,

In the shade of a ne’er fading laurel,
Whose grace in December is May.

This place is a banquet ef glory,
Which rings with the ditties of May.

The chamber of Chatham and Dolly,
A place of a comical play,
Gave place unto Lovel’s fine folly,
The birds and sweet flowers of May.

Here Venus attends with her lover,
Here Floras their suitors betray,

And uncommon secrets discover,

. » Which break from the bosom of May.

Here ever young Hebe sits smiling,
The wonders of youth to portray,

Excluding old age from defiling
The lads and the lassies of May.

Call by, little stranger, one minute,
Your joy will reward your delay;

Come, feast with the lark and the linnet,
And drink of the waters of May.

Walk in, little mistress, be steady,
You ’r welcome a visit to pay;
All things in the chamber are ready,
Resolve to be married in May.

DEATH OF A FAVORITE CHAMBER MAID

He now regrets his vain, his fruitless plarij
And sadly wonders at the faults of man.

’Tis now that sorrow feeds thé worm of paitt
With tears which never can the loss regain;
’Tis now he drinks the wormwood and thé

When from his breast the hope of fortune flies,
‘The songs of transport languish into sighs;

She, with delusive smiles, prevail’d to move
This silly heart into the snare of love ;

Folds her arms and turns her back on me.
When on my fancy’s eye her smiles she shed,
The torch by which deluded love was led,
‘Then, like a lark, from boyhood’s maze I

And thus in song her flattering’smiles adored.

From joy to joy my heart exulting flew,
In quest of one, though fair, yet far from true.

THE WOODMAN AND MONEY HUNTER:

Throughout our rambles much we find ;
‘The bee trees burst with honey ;

Wild birds we tame of every kind,

At once they seem to be resign’d;

T know but one that lags behind,
There’s nothing lags but money.

Fhe woods afford us much supply,
The opossum, coon, and coney ;
They all are tame and venture nigh,

Regardless of the public eye,
FE know but one among them shy,
‘There’s nothing shy but moncy.

And she lies in the bankrupt shade,
The cunning fox is funny ;

When thus the public debts are paid,

Deceitful cash is not afraid,

Where funds are hid for private trade,
There’s nothing paid but money.

""Phen let us roam the woods along;
And drive the coon and coney ;
Our lead’ is good, our powder strong,
To shoot the pigeons as they throng,

But sing’ no more the idle song,
Nor prowl the chase for money.

THE SETTING SUN.

’Tis sweet to trace the setting sun
Wheel blushing down the west ;

When his diurnal race is run,

The traveller stops the gloom to shun,
And lodge his bones to rest.

Far from the eye he sinks apace,
But still throws back his light
From oceans of resplendant grace,
Whence sleeping vesper paints her face,
And bids the sun good night.

To those hesperian fields by night
My thoughts in vision stray,

Like spirits stealing into light,

From gloom upon the wing of flight,
Soaring from time away.

Our eagle, with his pinions furl’d,

' Takes his departing peep,

And hails the occidental world,

Swift round whose base the globes are whirl’d,
Whilst weary creatures sleep.

Or leaves them on the willows hung,
And pass-time glee forever o’er ;

With ev’ning dew drops from thine eyej

The twilight bursting from thy wheels,
Ascends and bids oblivion fly.

THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT DOG.

He did not many ills regard,
A-fleet and harness cur ;

Indeed, he was a trusty dog,

And did not through the pastures prog;

The grazing flocks to stir, poor dog,
‘The grazing flocks to’ stir.

i

He through a field by chance was led;
In quest of ganie not far ahead,

And made one active leap ;
When all at once, alarm’d, he spied,
A creature welt'ring on its side,
A deadly wounded sheep, alas !

A deadly wounded sheep.

He there was fill’d with sudden fear,

Apprized of lurking danger near,
And there he left-his trail;

Indeed, he was afraid to yelp,

Nor could he grant the creature help,
But wheel’d and drop’d his tail, poor dog,
But wheel’d and drop’d his tail.

It was his pass-time, pride and fun,

At morn the nimble hare to run,
When frost was on the grass ;

Returning home who should he meet ?

The weather’s owner, coming fleet,

Who scorn’d to let him pass, alas !
Who scorn’d to let him pass.

_Tiger could but his bristles raise,

A surly compliment he pays,
Insulted shows his wrath ;

Returns a just defensive growl,

And does not turn aside to prowl,

But onward keeps the path, poor dog,
But onward keeps the path.

The raging owner found the brute,
But could afford it no recruit,
Nor raise it up to stand ;
*T'was mangled by some other dogs,
A set of detrimental rogues,
Raised up""at no eommand, alas !
Raised up at no command.

With powder, fire and ball ;

And then came back and eat the same ;

Let ev’ry harmless dog beware
Lest he be taken in the snare,
And scorn such fields to roam ;
A creature may be fraught with grace,
And suffer for the vile and base,
By straggling off from home, alas!

The blood of creatures oft is spilt,

Who die without a shade of guilt;

For pleasure, man in danger strays

So teach me to regard my day,
How small a point my life appears ;
One gleam to death the whole betrays,
A momentary flash of years.

One moment smiles, the scene is past,
Life’s gaudy bloom at once we shed,
And sink beneath affliction’s blast,
Or drop as soon among the dead.

Short is the chain wound up at morn,
Which oft runs down and stops at noon;
Thus in a moment man is born,
And, lo! the creature dies as soon.

EARLY AFFECTION.

I loved thee from the earliest dawn,
When first I saw thy beauty’s ray;
And will until life’s eve comes on,
And beauty’s blossom fades away;
And when all things go well with thee,
With smiles or tears remember me.

Pll love thee when thy morn is past
And wheedling galantry is o’er,
When youth is lost in age’s blast,
And beauty can ascend no more;
And when life’s journey ends with thee,
O then look back and think of me.

Til love thee with a smile or frown,
Mid sorrow’s gloom or pleasure’s light;
And when the chain of life runs down,
Pursue thy last eternal flight;
When thou hast spread thy wing to flee,
Still, still 9 moment wait for me.

I love thee for those sparkling eyes,
‘To which my fondness was betray’d,
Bearing the tincture of the skies,
‘To glow when other beauties fade;
And when they sink too low to see,
Reflect an azure beam on me,

And creaning wear my bell-crown hat;

Reclining on a cultivated Jand,

Which often spread beneath a college bower,

And thus invoked the intellectual shower ;

The smile of courts and states shall shed re-

I frown upon the gloom of rustic life,

No mark between the thistle and the rose ;

And bold defy the power supreme,
And thus their God disown.

High on a dome of state,
From azure fields he cast his. daring eye,
Licentious trains his magazines await,
At whose command they fly.
The gloom excludes celestial charms,
When all the angels rush to arms,
Heaven shakes beneath the vast alarms, _
And earth begins to sigh.

Eternal mountains move,
And seven-fold thunders rock the hills below,
While star ry throngs desert the worlds above,
Beneath Jehovah’s brow.
0 Lucifer, thou morning son,
To glut thy pide what hast thou done?
Sing, O ye heavens, the plague is gone,
And weep, thou earth, for wo.

Creation felt the fall,
And trembling 1 nature heav’d a dismal groan;
For that rebellion ‘brought her into thrall,
t She must her fate bemoan ;
See angels fall no more to rise,
And feed the worm that never dies ;
No ear of grace ean hear their cries,
And hoarse amenting tone.

Weak nature lay aoe,
And felt the wound in pleasing hate conceal’d;
And, void of ieee the secret charm disclosed
Which ev’ry ill reveal’d.
The venom struck through ev’ry vein,
And every creature felt the pain;
But undefiled a lamb was slain,
By which the wound ‘was heal’d.

TO MISS TEMPE.

Bless’d hope, when Tempe takes her last

long flight, }

And leaves her lass-lorn lover to complain,
Like Luna mantling o’er the brow of night,

Thy glowing wing dispels the gloom of pain,

Yes, wondrous hope, when Tempe sails afar,
Thy vital lamp remains to burn behind, —

While by-gone pleasure, like a setting star,
Reflects her glory o’er the twilight mind,

Thy glowing wing was never spread to tire,
Expanded o’er the mansion of the brave,
To fan and set the heaving breast on fire,
That soars in triumph from affliction’s
wave.

Then, Tempe, dart along the ocean drear,
Hope yet forbids my cheerful soul to weep,

But marks thy passage with affection’s tear,
And hails thee on the bosom of the deep.

Farewell, since thou wilt leave thy native
shore,
I smile to think I am not left alone ;
Auspicious hope shall yet my peace restore,
When thou art from the beach forever gone.

MAN A TORCH.

Blown up with painful care, and hard to light,
A glimmering torch, blown in a moment out;
Suspended by a webb, an angler’s bait,
Floating at stake along the stream of chance,
Snatch’d from its hook by the fish of poyerty.
A silent cavern is his last abode ;
The king’s repository, veil’d with gloom,
The umbrage of a thousand oziers ; bowed,
The couch of hallowed -bones, the slave’s asy-
lum,
The brave’s retreat, and end of ev’ry care.
