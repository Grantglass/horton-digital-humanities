jLhus did a captured wretch complain,
*'Imploring heaven above, —
,Till one with sympathetic pain,

Flew to his arms and broke the chain,

‘ And grief took iigiie from love.’

Let clouds of danger rise and roar,

And hope’s firm pillars move ; '
With storms behind and death before,
O grant me this, I‘érave to more, ~

When nature wakes soft pity’s coo
The hawk deserts the dove,

Compassion melts the creature through, :

With palpitations feli by few, u
' The ‘wrecking throbs of love.

Let surly discord take its flight
From wedloek’s peaceful grove,
While tmion breaks thé arm of fight,
With darkness swallow’d up in light,

. ° whines is there like love. nee
