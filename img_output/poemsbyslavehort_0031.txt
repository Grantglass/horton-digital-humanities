POEMS BY A SLAVE. 21

LINES,
On hearing of the intention of a gentleman to purchase
the Poet’s freedom.

When on life’s ocean first I spread my sail,

I then implored a mild auspicious gale; _
And from the slippery strand I took my flight,
And sought the peaceful haven of delight.

Tyrannic storms arose upon my soul,

And dreadful did their mad’ning thunders roll ;
The pensive muse was shaken from her sphere,
And hope, it vanish’d in the clouds of fear.

At length a golden sun broke through the gloom,
And from his smiles arose a sweet perfume—

A calm ensued, and birds began o sing,

And lo! the sacred muse resumed her wing.

With frantic joy she chaunted as she flew,

And kiss’d the clement hand that bore her through ;
Her envious foes did from her sight retreat,

Or prostrate fall beneath her burning feet.

*T was like a proselyte, allied to Heaven—

Or rising spirits’ boast of sins forgiven,
Whose shout dissolves the adamant away,
Whose melting voice the stubborn rocks obey.

’T was like the salutation of the dove,

Borne on the zephyr through some lonesome grove,
‘When Spring returns, and Winter’s chill is past,
And vegetation smiles above the blast.

Twas like the evening of a nuptial pair,

When love pervades the hour of sad despair—
°’T was like fair Helen’s sweet return to Troy,
‘When every Grecian bosom swell’d with joy.

The silent harp which on the osiers hung,
‘Was then attuned, and manumission sung :
Away by hope the clouds of fear were driven,
And music breathed my gratitude to Heaven.

Hard was the race to reach the distant goal,
The needle oft was shaken from the pole;

In such distress who could forbear to weep ?
Toss’d by the headlong billows of the deep !
