Hope, tell me, dear passion, which must earth
“survive,
That love will be sweeter when nature is

~ over, :

And still without pain though eternity live,
In the triumph of pleasure when time is na

more.

O love, when the day-light of pleasure shall
close, ;
Let the vesper of death break on life’s dus-
ky even;
Let the faint sun of time set in peace as it
rose, :
And eternity open thy morning in heaven.

Then hope, lovely passion, thy torch shall
expire,
Effusing on nature life’s last feeble ray;
While the night maid of love sets her taper
‘on fire,
To guard smiling beauty from time far
away.

 

FAREWELL TO FRANCES.
