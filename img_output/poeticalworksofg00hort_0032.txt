Some unknown finger thumps the door,
.. From one of faltering voice,

Till some one seems to walk the floor
With an alarming noise.

The drum of horror holds her sound,

. Which will not let me sleep,
When ghastly breezes float around,
And hidden goblins creep.

Methinks I hear some constant groan,
The din of all the dead,

While trembling thus I lie alone,
Upon this restless bed.

At length the blaze of morning broke
On my, impatient view, ae

And truth or fancy told the joke,
And bade the night adion

"Twas but the noise of Tiivling rats, e
. Which ran with all their speed,

Pursued in haste by hungry. cats,
Which on the vermin feed.

The cat growl’ das she held’ ‘her, prey,
Which shriek’d with all its might,

And drove the balm of sleep : away
Throughout the live-long night.
