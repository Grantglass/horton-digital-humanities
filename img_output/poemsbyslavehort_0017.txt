POEMS BY A SLAVE. 9

Thus oft in the valley I think, and I wonder
Why cannot a maid with her lover agree ?

Thy looks are so pleasing, thy charms so amazing,
I pine for no other, my true-love, but thee.

I'd fly from thy frowns with a heart full of sorrow—
Return, pretty damsel, and smile thou on me;

By every endeavour, 1’1] try thee for ever,
And languish until I am fancied by thee.

ON THE DEATH OF AN INFANT.

Blest Babe! it at length has withdrawn,
The Seraphs have rocked it to sleep ;

Away with an angelic smile it has gone,
And left a sad parent to weep !

It soars from the ocean of pain,
On breezes of precious perfume ;

O be not discouraged when death is but gain—
The triumph of life from the tomb.

With pleasure I thought it my own,
And smil’d on its infantile charms ;

But some mystic bird, like an eagle, came down,
And snatch’d it away from my arms.

Blest Babe, it ascends into Heaven,
It mounts with delight at the call ;

And flies to the bosom from whence it was given,
The Parent and Patron of all.

THE SLAVE’S COMPLAINT.

Am I sadly cast aside,

On misfortune’s rugged tide ?

Will the world my pains deride
For ever ?

Must I dwell in Slavery’s night,

And all pleasure take its flight,

Far beyond my feeble sight,
For ever?
