And marks her rolling planets as they shine; -

Describes the magnitude of every star,

And thence pursues her comets as they roll
afar.

But nature never yet was half explored, -
Though by philosopher and bard adored;
Astronomer and naturalist expire, :
And languish that they could ascend no higher;
Expositors of words in every tongue,
Writers of prose and scribblers of song,
Would fail with all their mathematic powers,
And vainly study out their fleeting hours.
Sir Walter Raleigh, Pen and:Roberson,
With Morse and Snowden, who are dead and

gone,
They all were, though mused _ their fee
away,
And left ten thousand wonders to display.
And though the fiery chemists probe the mine
The subterraneous bodies to define;
Though melting flames the force of matter try,
Rocks mixâ€™d with brass and gold to pieces fly;
And those who follow the electric muse,
Amidst the wilds of vast creation loose
Themselves like pebbles in the swelling main,
And strive for naught these wanders to ex-
plain; !
