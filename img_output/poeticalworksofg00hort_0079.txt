iMPLORING TO BE RESIGNED AT DEATH.

Let me die and not tremble at death;
But smile at the close of my day;
And then, at the flight of my breath,
Like a bird of the morning in May.
Go chanting away.

Let me die without fear of the dead,
No horrors my soul shall dismay, Z
And with fuithâ€™s pillow wider my head, _
With defiance to mortal decay,
Go chanting away.

Let me die like a son of the brave,
And martial distinction display,
Nor shrink from a thought of the grave;
No, but with a smile from the clay;
Go chanting away:

Let me die glad, regardless of pain,
No pang to this world to betray ;
And the spirit cut loose from its chain,
So loath in the flesh to delay,

Go chanting away.

Jet me die, and my worst foe forgive,
When death veils the last vital ray ;
