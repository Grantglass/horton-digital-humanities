She does not thus her gifts impart,
Her aid is from a feeling heart,
A principle within.

When the lone stranger, forced to roam,
Comes shiv’ring to her door,

At once he finds a weleome home, ”:

The torch of grace dispels his gloom,
And bids him grope no more.

Friendship was never known to fail
The voice of need to hear,
When ruthless ills our peace assail, -
When from our hearts she draws the veil,
Aud drys the falling tear.

When dogs and devils snarl and fight,
She hides and dwells alone;
When friends and kindred disunite,
With pity she surveys the right,
And gives to each his own.

Friendship has not 2 sister grace
Iler wonders to exceed;

She is the queen of all her race,

Whose charms the stoutest must embrace
When in the vale of need.
