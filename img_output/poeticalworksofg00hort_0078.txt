‘74

With tones as the pealing of bells, _
Farewell to the brave and the fair.

O Moscow, thou city of grace,
Consign’d to a dread burning pyre,

From morning to ev’ning with sorrow I trace
The wild winds, the smoke, and the fire.

The dogs in the kennel all howl,

The wether takes flight with the ox,
Appal’d on the wing is the fowl,

The pigeon deserting her box.

With a heart full of pain, in the night’
Mid hillocks and bogs I retire,
Through lone, deadly vallies I steer by its
light,
The wild storm, the smoke, and the fite.

Though far the crash breaks on my ear,
The stars glimmer dull in the sky,
The shrieks of the women I hear,
The fall of the kingdom is ae

O heaven, when earth is no more, .
And all things in nature expire,
May I thus, with safety, keep distant before
‘The whirlwinds, the smoke, and the fire.
