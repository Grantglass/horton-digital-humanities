Sagacious ‘Tiger left his bogs,
But bore the blame of other dogs,
With powder, fire and ball ;
They kill’d the poor, unlawful game,
And then came back and eat the same ;
But Tiger paid for all, poor dog,
But Tiger paid for all.

Let ev’ry harmless dog beware
Lest he be taken in the snare,
And scorn such fields to roam ;
A creature may be fraught with grace,
And suffer for the vile and base,
By straggling off from home, alas!
By straggling off from home.

The blood of creatures oft is spilt,

Who die without a shade of guilt;
Look out, or cease to roam 3

Whilst up and down the world he plays

For pleasure, man in danger strays

Without a friend from home, alas !
Without a friend from home.
