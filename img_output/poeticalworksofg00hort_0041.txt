_ *Tis sweet to listen to her nightly tune,
Deprived of star-light or the smiling moon.
When deadly winds sweep round the rural

shed, ;
And tell of strangers. lost, without a bed,
Fond sympathy invokes her dol’rous lay,
And pleasure steals in sorrow’s gloom away, f
Till fost’ring Somnus bids my eyes to close,
And smiling visions open to repose;
Stillon my. soothing couch I lie at ease, :
Still round my chamber flows the whistli
breeze, ‘

Still in the chain of sleep I lie. ‘confined,
‘To all the threat’ning ills of life resign’d,
Regardless of the wand’ring elfe of night,
While phantoms break on my_ immortal sight,
The trump of morning bids my ‘slumbers end,
While from a flood of rest I straight ascend,
When on a busy world I cast my eyes, —
And"think of nightly slumbers with surptise. ”

 

ON AN OLD DELUDED SUITOR:

See sad deluded love, in years too late,. .
With tears aethending o’er the tomb of fate,
While dusky evening’s veil excludes the light
Which in the morning’ broke upon his sight.
