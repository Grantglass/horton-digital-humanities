Just like that star which downwards shot,
It glimmers and is seen no ifiore.

Teach me to draw this transient breath,
With conscious awe my end to prove,
Early to make my peace with death,
As thus in haste from time we"move.

O heaven, through this murky vale,
Direct me with a buriting pen $

Thus shall I on a tuneful gale
Fleet out my threescore years and ten.

 

TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

Friendship, thou balm for ev’ry ill,
I must aspire to thee;

Whose breezes bid the heart be still,

And render sweet the patient’s pill,
And set the pris’ner free.

Friendship, it is the softest soul
Which feels‘ another’s pain;

And must with equal sighs condole,

While sympathetic streamlets roll;
Which nothing can restrains

Not to be nominated smart;
Of mortals to be seen,
