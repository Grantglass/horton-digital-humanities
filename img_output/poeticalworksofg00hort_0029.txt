Hast thou gone and left me, -
Void of faults but,strictly true ?
Fly far away .
Without. delay, ..
Adieu, my love, adieu.

Hast thou gone and left me, ;
Hence to seek another bride ?
I must be still, :
. Thou hast thy will, -.
, The world is free and wide.

Only, hadst thou told.me _.

Ere I drunk the bitter cup,
I could with shame, .,.
Now. bear the blame,

And freely give thee up.

Bat T’m left to ponder, . :
Now in the depth of sorrow’s foi: 3
Like some dull sprite,
In dead of night, __
Bewailing o’er her tomb.
