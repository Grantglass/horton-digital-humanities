POEMS BY A SLAVE.

Worst of all, must Hope grow dim,
And withhold her cheering beam?
Rather let me sleep and dream

For ever !

Something still my heart surveys,

Groping through this dreary maze 5

Is it Hope 1—then burn and blaze
For ever!

Leave me not a wretch confined,

Altogether Jame and blind—

Unto gross despair consigned,
For ever!

Heaven! in whom can I confide?
Canst thou not for all provide?
Condescend to be my guide

For ever:

And when this transient life shall end,
Oh, may some kind, eternal friend
Bid me from servitude ascend,

For ever!

neg Soh Soo —

ON THE TRUTH OF THE SAVIOUR.

E’en John the Baptist did not know
Who Christ the Lord could be,
And bade his own disciples go,
The strange event to see.

They said, Art thou the one of whom
*T was written long before ?

Is there another still to come,
Who will all things restore ?

This is enough, without a name—
Go, tell him what is done;

Behold the feeble, weak and lame,
With strength rise up and run.

This is enough—the blind now see,
The dumb Hosannas sing ;

Devils far from his presence flee,
As shades from morning’s wing.
