THE EYE OF LOVE.
3
T know her story-telling eye
Has more expression than her tongiie;
And from that heart-extorted sigh, ©
At once the peal of love is rung.

When that soft eye lets fall a tear
OF doating f fondness as we part, .
The stream is 2 from” a cause sincere,
And issues from a ‘melting heart.

What shall her fluttering’ pulse restrain,
The life-watch beating from her soul,

When all the power, of hate i is slain,
And love permits it no control.

When said her tongue, I ‘en thee well?
Her eye ¢ declared it must be true ;

And every. sentence seem’d to tell
The tale of sorrow told by few.

When low. she ae and wheel’d aside,”
IT saw her blushing ‘temples fade;”

Her smiles were sunk i in sorrow’s tide,”
But love was in her eye —— qd.
