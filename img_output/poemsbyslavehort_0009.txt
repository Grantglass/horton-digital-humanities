POEMS BY A SLAVE. 3

PRAISE OF CREATION.

Creation fires my tongue!
Nature thy anthems raise ;
And spread the universal song
Of thy Creator’s praise !

Immediately after the present edition was issued, the follow-

ing letter was put into my hands. PuBLISHER.

Washington, September 12th, 1837.
Dear Sir:—I have inquired of Mr. Gales, agreeably to your
request to ‘ascertain the present condition of George M. Horton.
He informs me that he is still the slave of James Horton of
Chatham County, and is employed as a servant at Chapel Hill,
the seat of the University of North Carolina. It is understood
by Mr. G, that he did not derive much pecuniary profit from the
publication of his poems; and that, since the death of his pa-
tron, the late Dr. Caldwell, President of the University he has
attended to other occupations.
Jam,

Yours truly,
KEKE

Mr. Josuvua Corrin.

The angels heard the tune
Throughout creation ring ;
They seized their golden harps as soon
And touched on every string.

When time and space were young
And music rolled along— ;

The morning stars together sung,
And Heaven was drown’d in song.

Ye towering eagles soar,
And fan Creation’s blaze,
And ye terrific lions roar,
To your Creator’s praise,
