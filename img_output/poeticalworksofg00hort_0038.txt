Mid rocks and hills where waters roll sublime, -
*Tis sweet to think of home.

My retrospective gaze

Bounds on a dark horizon far behind,

But yet the stars of homely pleasures blaze
And glimmer on my mind,

When pealing thunders roll, )
And roffian winds howl, threat’ning life with
gloom,
‘To Heaven’s kind hand I then commit the
whole,
And smile to think of home.

But cease, my pensive soul,
To languish at departure’s gloomy shrine;
Still look in front and hail the joyful goal, .
The pleasure teeming line.

When on the deep wide sea
{ wander, sailing mid the swelling foam,
Tost from the land by many a long degree,
O, then I think of thee.

I never shail forget
‘The by-gone pleasures of my native shore,
Until the sun of life forbears to set,

And pain is known no more.
