My nuils, the only balm,
To ev’ry bump are oft applied,
And thus the rage will sweetly calm
Which aggravates my hide,

Tt soon returns again;
A frown succeeds to ev’ry smile ;
Grinning I scrateh and curse the pain,
But grieve to be so vile.

In fine, I know not which

Can play the most deceitful game,
The devil, sulphur, or the itch;

The three are but the same,

The devil sows the itch,
_ Aad sulphur has a loathsome smell,
And with my clothes as black as pitch,
1 stink where’er I dwell.

Excoriated deep,
By friction play’d on ev’ry part,
Tt oft deprives me of my sleep,
And plagues me to my heart.
