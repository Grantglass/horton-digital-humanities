Invoking that love which forbs him to
die. :

Sweet hape, lovely passion, my, grief ever
chase,
And scatter the gloom which veils plea-
sure’s bright ray,
O lend me thy wings, and assist me to trace
The flight of my fair one when gone far
away.

When the dim star of pleasure sets glimmer-

The planet of beauty on life’s dreary ‘shore,
And th’ fair bird of fancy forever is flown,
On pinions of haste to be heard of no more,

To flourish still sweetly and blossom as
gay,
Expelling like morning the gloom of regret,
When the lark of affection is gone far away.

If hurried into some unchangeable. clime,
Where oceans of pleasure continually roll,

Far, far from the limited borders. of time,
With a total division of body and soul.
