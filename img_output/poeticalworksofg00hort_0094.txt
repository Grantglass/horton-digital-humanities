Eternal mountains move,
And seven-fold thunders rock the hills below,
While star ry throngs desert the worlds above,
Beneath Jehovah’s brow.
0 Lucifer, thou morning son,
To glut thy pide what hast thou done?
Sing, O ye heavens, the plague is gone,
And weep, thou earth, for wo.

Creation felt the fall,
And trembling 1 nature heav’d a dismal groan;
For that rebellion ‘brought her into thrall,
t She must her fate bemoan ;
See angels fall no more to rise,
And feed the worm that never dies ;
No ear of grace ean hear their cries,
And hoarse amenting tone.

Weak nature lay aoe,
And felt the wound in pleasing hate conceal’d;
And, void of ieee the secret charm disclosed
Which ev’ry ill reveal’d.
The venom struck through ev’ry vein,
And every creature felt the pain;
But undefiled a lamb was slain,
By which the wound ‘was heal’d.
