THE MUSICAL CHAMBER.

I rrust that my friends will remember,
Whilst I these my pleasures display,
Resort to my musical chamber,
The laurel crown’d desert in May.

Resort to this chamber at leisure,
Attend it by night and by day;
To feast on the dainties of pleasure,

Which cannot be stinted in May.

This place is both pleasing and moral,
A chamber both lovely and gay,

In the shade of a ne’er fading laurel,
Whose grace in December is May.

Abounding with every fine story, |
While time passes hurrying away,
