POEMS BY A SLAVE. 19

ON THE POETIC MUSE.

Far, far above this world I soar,
And almost nature lose,
Aerial regions to explore,
With this ambitious Muse.

My towering thoughts with pinions rise,
Upon the gales of song,

Which waft me through the mental skies,
With music on my tongue,

My Muse is all on mystic fire,
Which kindles in my breast;

To scenes remote she doth aspire,
As never yet exprest,

Wrapt in the dust she scorns to lie,
Call’d by new charms away ;

Nor will she e’er refuse to try
Such wonders to survey.

Such is the quiet bliss of soul,
When in some calm retreat,

Where pensive thoughts like streamlets roll,
And render silence sweet ;

And when the vain tumultuous crowd
Shakes comfort from my mind,

My muse ascends above the cloud
And leaves the noise behind.

With vivid flight she mounts on high
Above the dusky maze,

And with a perspicacious eye
Doth far ’bove nature gaze,
