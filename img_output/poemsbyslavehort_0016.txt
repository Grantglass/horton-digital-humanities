POEMS BY A SLAVE.

Oh, blest asylum—heavenly balm !
Unto thy boughs J flee—
And in thy shades the storm shall calm,
With songs of Liberty !

Eliza, tell thy lover why

Or what induced thee to deceive me ?
Fare thee well—away I fly—

I shun the lass who thus will grieve me.

Eliza, still thou art my song,
Although by force I may forsake thee;
Fare thee well, for I was wrong
To woo thee while another take thee.

Eliza, pause and think awhile—
Sweet lass! I shall forget thee never:
Fare thee well ! although I smile,

I grieve to give thee up for ever.

Eliza, I shall think of thee—
My heart shall ever twine about thee ;
Fare thee well—but think of me,
Compell’d to live and die without thee.
“Fare thee well !—and if for ever,
Still for ever fare thee well !”

LOVE.

‘Whilst tracing thy visage, I sink in emotion,
For no other damsel so wond’rous I see;

Thy looks are so pleasing, thy charms so amazing,
1 think of no other, my true-love, but thee.

With heart-burning rapture I gaze on thy beauty,
And fly like a bird to the boughs of a tree;

Thy looks are so pleasing, thy charms so amazing,
I fancy no other, my true-love, but thee.
