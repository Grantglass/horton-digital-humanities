THE HAPPY BIRD'S NEST.

When on my cottage falls the placid shower,

When ev’ning calls the labourer home to
rest,

When glad the bee deserts the humid flower,

O then the bird assumes her peaceful nest,

When sable shadows grow unshapely tall,
And Sol’s resplendent wheel descends the
“west,
The knell of respiration tolls fer all,
And Hesper smiles upon the linnet’s nest.

When o’er the mountain bounds the fair ga-
zell,
The night bird tells her day-departing jest,
She gladly leaves her aapcholy dell,
And spreads her pinions o’er the linnet’s
nest.

Then harmless Dian spreads her lucid sail,
And glides through ether with her silver
crest,
Bidding the watchful bird still pour her tale,
‘And cheer the happy linnet on her nest.

Thus may some guardian angel bear her light,
And o’er thy tomb, departed genius, rest,
