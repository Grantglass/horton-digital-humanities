Disgorge no more thy killing bane,
The bird hope flies from thee in pain,"
To return more never!

 

ROSABELLA—PURITY OF HEART,

Though with an angel’s tongue
I set on fire the congregations all,
"Tis but a brazen bell that I have rung,
And I to nothing fall;
My theme is but an idle air
If Rosabella is not there,

Though I in thunders rave,
And hurl the blaze of orateric flowers,
Others I move, but fail myself to save
With my declaiming powers;
I sink, alas! I:know not where,
If Rosabella is not there.

Though f point ont the way,
And closely circumscribe the path to heaven,
And pour my melting prayer without delay,
And vow my sins forgiven, __
I sinkjinto the gloom despait-

Yf Rosabella is not theré,
