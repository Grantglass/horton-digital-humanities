Aurora mounts without delay,
With brooms of light the plains to sweep,
And purge the gloom away.

Our king is coming now in sighit,
Bearing the diadem of day,
Whose érest expels the night.

To groves, and hide from ev’ry eye;

Our slumb’ring dust will rise and meet
Its morning in the sky.

Now hid within enipyreal gloom;
