Though I may mountains move, é
And make tbe vallies vocal with my song,
I’m vain without a stream of mystic love,
For all my heart is wrong;
I’ve laid myself a eruel snare,
If Resabella is not there.

From bibliothiec stores,
I fly, proclaiming heaven from land to land,
Or cross the seas and reach their distantshores,
Mid Gothic groups to stand;
O, let me of myself beware,
If Rosabella is not there.

Our classic books must fail,
And with their flowery tongues to ashes
, burn,
And not one groat a mortal wit avail
Upon his last return;
Be this the creature’s faithful prayer,
‘That Rosabella may be there.

This spotless maid was born
~ The babe of heaven, and cannot be defiled;
The soul is dead and in a state forlorn
On which she has not smiled;
' Vain are the virile and the fair,
Ae Rosabella be not there.
