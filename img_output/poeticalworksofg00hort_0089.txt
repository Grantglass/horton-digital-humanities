85
My eyes let fall a friendly. tear,
And bid this place farewell.

Attending servants come,

The carriage wheels like thunders roar,
‘fo bear the pensive seniors home,

Here to be seen no more.

Pass oné more trarisient night,
The morning sweeps the college clean;
The graduate takes his last long flight,
No more in college seen: :
The bee, which courts the flower,
Must with some pain itself employ;
And then fly, at the day’ ‘g last hour;
Home to its hive with joy.

 

 

‘TO THE KING OF MACEDONIA:
Phillip, thou art mortal !
Thou may’st with pleasure haif the dawn;
And greet the morning’s eye ;
Remember, king, the night comes on,
The fleeting day will soot be gone,

Not distant, loud proclaims the funeral tone,
Phillip, thou hast to die.
