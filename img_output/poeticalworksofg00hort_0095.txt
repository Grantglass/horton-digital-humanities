TO MISS TEMPE.

Bless’d hope, when Tempe takes her last

long flight, }

And leaves her lass-lorn lover to complain,
Like Luna mantling o’er the brow of night,

Thy glowing wing dispels the gloom of pain,

Yes, wondrous hope, when Tempe sails afar,
Thy vital lamp remains to burn behind, —

While by-gone pleasure, like a setting star,
Reflects her glory o’er the twilight mind,

Thy glowing wing was never spread to tire,
Expanded o’er the mansion of the brave,
To fan and set the heaving breast on fire,
That soars in triumph from affliction’s
wave.

Then, Tempe, dart along the ocean drear,
Hope yet forbids my cheerful soul to weep,

But marks thy passage with affection’s tear,
And hails thee on the bosom of the deep.

Farewell, since thou wilt leave thy native
shore,
I smile to think I am not left alone ;
Auspicious hope shall yet my peace restore,
When thou art from the beach forever gone.
