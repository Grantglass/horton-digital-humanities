He now regrets his vain, his fruitless plarij
And sadly wonders at the faults of man.
Tis now from beauty’s torch he wheels aside, _
And strives to soar above affection’s tide;
’Tis now that sorrow feeds thé worm of paitt
With tears which never can the loss regain;
’Tis now he drinks the wormwood and thé
gall, Bea
And all the sweets of early pleasures pally
When from his breast the hope of fortune flies,
‘The songs of transport languish into sighs;
eg: lovely rose, that beamed as she blew,
all the charms of youth the most untrue,
She, with delusive smiles, prevail’d to move
This silly heart into the snare of love ;
Then like a flower closed against thé bee,
Folds her arms and turns her back on me.
When on my fancy’s eye her smiles she shed,
The torch by which deluded love was led,
‘Then, like a lark, from boyhood’s maze I
soar’d, :
And thus in song her flattering’smiles adored.
My heart was then by fondling love betray’d,
A thousand pleasures bloom’d but soon’ to’
fade,
From joy to joy my heart exulting flew,
In quest of one, though fair, yet far from true.
