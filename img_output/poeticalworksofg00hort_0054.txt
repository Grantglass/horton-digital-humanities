When winter succeeds to the summer;
‘The bird is too chilly to sing ;

No music is play’d for the drummer,
No carol is heard on the wing.

The court of a nation forsaken,
An edifice stripp’d of its dome,
its fame from her pinnacle shaken,

Like the sigh heaving downfall of Rome. —

Fall’n, fall’n is the chief of the witty,
The prince of republican power 5
The star-crown of Washington City |

Descends his political tower. _

‘The gold-plated seat is bespoken,
The brave of the west is before’;

The bowl at the fountain is broken,
‘The music of fame is no more.

Wo longer a wonderful story
Ts toll for the brave whig to hear,
Whose sun leaves his circuit of glory,
Or sinks from the light of his sphere.
