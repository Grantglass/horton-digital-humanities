hope directs him through the gloom of trial
to the object of his choice.
My brightest hopes are mix’d with tears,
Like hues of light and gloom;
As when mid sun-shine rain appears,
Love rises with a thousand fears,

To pine and still to bloom.
When I have told my last fond tale
In lines of song to thee,
And for departure spread my sail,
? Say, lovely princess, wilt thou fail
To drop a tear for me?

O, princess, should my votive strain
Salute thy ear no more,

Like one deserted on the main,

I still shall gaze, alas! but vain,
On wedlock’s flow’ry shore.

 

TROUBLED WITH THE ITCH, AND RUB-
BING WITH SULPHUR.
Tis bitter, vet ’lis sweet,
Scratching effects but transient ease ;
* Pleasure and pain together meet,

And vanish as they please.
