Friendship is but the fecling sigh,
The sympathizing tear, .
Constrain’d to flow till others dry,
Nor lets the needy soul pass by,

Nor scorns to see or hear.

ON THE CONVERSION OF A SISTER.

*Tis the voice of my sister at heme,
Resigt’d to the treasures above,
Inviting the strangers to come,
And feast at the banquet of love.

Tis a spirit cut loose from its chain,
‘Fis the voice of a culprit forgiven,
Restored from a prison of pain,
With th’ sound ofaconcert from heaven.

*Tis a beam from the regions of light,
A touch of beatific fire;

A spirit exulting for flight,
With a strong and impatient desire.

Tis a drop from the ocean of love,
A foretaste of pleasures to come,
Distill’d from the fountain above,
The joy which awaits her at home.
