Languishes mid her flowery train,
Whilst pleasure flies like fumes away.

Vain pleasures, O how short to last!
Like leaves which quick to ashes burn;
Which kindle from the slightest blast,
And slight to nothing:hence return.

THE POWERS OF LOVE.

It lifts the poor man from his cell
To fortune’s bright alcove ;

Its mighty sway few, few can tell,

Mid envious foes it conquers iil;
There’s nothing half like love.

» Ye weary strangers, void of rest,

Who late through life have strove,
Like the late bird which seeks its nest,
If you would hence in truth be blest,

Light on the bough of love.

The vagrant plebeian, void of friends,
Constrain’d through wilds to rove,

On this his safety whole depends,

One faithful smile his trouble ends,

_ A smile of constant love.
