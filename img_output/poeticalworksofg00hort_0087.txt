Galvin himself, the monarch of the whole,
Would blush his empty parchments to unroll,
These different branches to one ocean go,
Where all the streams of life together flow,
Where perfect wisdom swells the tide of joy,
A tide which must eternity employ;
A boundless sea of love without a shore,
Whose pleasure ebbs and flows forever more;
Volume Divine! O thou the sacred dew,
Thy fadeless fields see elders passing through,
Thy eenstant basis must support the whole,
The cabinet and alcove of the soul;
It matters not through what we may have
passâ€™d,
To thee for sure support we fly at last;
Encyclopedias we may wander o'er,
And study every scientifie lore,
Ancient and modern authors we may read,
The soul must starve or on thy pastures feed.
These bibliothic charms would surely fall,
And life grow dim within this college wall,
The wheels of study in the mind would tire,
If not supported by thy constant fire;
Greatest of all the precepts ever taught
Maps and vocabularies dearly bought,
Burns with his harp, Scott, Cambell, and their
flowers, ;
