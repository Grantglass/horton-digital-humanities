A skillful tune for Henry Clay !
Let every ear
With transport hear!
The President is come.

Let sister states grect the Columbian feast,
With each admiring guest ;
Thou art our choice!
Let ev’ry joyful voice,
Sound from the east to west ;
Let haughty Albion’s lion roar,
The eagle must prevail to soar ;
And in lovely form,
Above the storm,
Erect her peaceful nest.

Beyond each proud empire she throws her
eye!
Which lifted to the sky,
No thunders roll,
To agitate her soul,
Beneath her feet they fly !
Let skillful fingers sweep the lyre,
Strike ev’ry ear! set hearts on fire!
Let monarchs sleep
Beyond the deep,
And howling faction dic.
