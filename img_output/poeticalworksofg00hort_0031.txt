27

Death is a joyful doom,

_ Let tears of sorrow dry,

The rose on earth but fades to bloom
And blossom in the sky.

Why Should the soul resist the hand

‘That bears her to celestial land.

Then, bonny bird, farewell,

Till hence we meet againf
Perhaps I have not long to dwell
Within this cumb’rous chain,

Till on elysian shores we meet,
‘Till grief is lost and j joy complete.

THE FEARFUL TRAVELLER IN THE’
HAUNTED CASTLE:

Oft do T hear those windows épe
And shut with dread surpiise,
And spirits murmur as they grope,’

But break not on the eyes.

Still fancy spies the winding sheet;
The phantom and the shroud;

And bids the pulse of horror beat
Throughout my ears aloud.
