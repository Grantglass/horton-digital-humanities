Nor henee forget. the eeene applauding day,
‘When every heart was pay ;
The universal swell
Rush’d from the loud town bell }
_ In awful, grand array,
We sce them form the bright parade ;
And hark, a gladdening march is play’d!
Along the strect,
The theme is sweet,
For every voice is Clay.

To the Capitol the low and upland peers
Resort with princely fears,
And homage pay ;
A loud huzza for Clay !
Falls on our ears;
Loud from his lips the thunders roll;
- And fill with wonder every soul ;
Round the sire of state
All concentrate,
And é¥ér¥ mortal hears.

CLAY’S DEFEAT.

*Tis the hope of the noble defeated ;
The aim of the marksman is vain
The wish of destruction completed,

The soldier eternally slain.
