Nor could he grant the creature help,
But wheel’d and drop’d his tail, poor dog,
But wheel’d and drop’d his tail.

It was his pass-time, pride and fun,

At morn the nimble hare to run,
When frost was on the grass ;

Returning home who should he meet ?

The weather’s owner, coming fleet,

Who scorn’d to let him pass, alas !
Who scorn’d to let him pass.

_Tiger could but his bristles raise,

A surly compliment he pays,
Insulted shows his wrath ;

Returns a just defensive growl,

And does not turn aside to prowl,

But onward keeps the path, poor dog,
But onward keeps the path.

The raging owner found the brute,
But could afford it no recruit,
Nor raise it up to stand ;
*T'was mangled by some other dogs,
A set of detrimental rogues,
Raised up"at no eommand, alas !
Raised up at no command.
