POEMS BY A SLAVE.

Never, till death’s resistless blow,
Whose cal] the dearest must obey—
In twain together then may go,
And thus together dwel! for aye.

Say to the suitor, Come away,

Nor break the knot which love has tied—
Nor to the world thy trust betray,

And fly for ever from thy bride.

ned, Eo —

THE LOVER’S FAREWELL.

And wilt thou, love, my soul display,
And all my secret thoughts betray?
I strove, but could not hold thee fast,
My heart flies off with thee at last.

The favorite daughter of the dawn,

On love’s mild breeze will soon be gone;
I strove, but could not cease to love,
Nor from my heart the weight remove.

And wilt thou, love, my soul beguile,
And gull thy fav’rite with a smile?
Nay, soft affection answers, nay,

And beauty wings my heart away.

i steal on tiptoe from these bowers,
All spangled with a thousand flowers ;
I sigh, yet leave them all behind,

To gain the object of my mind.

And wilt thou, love, command my soul,
And waft me with a light control ?—
Adieu to all the blooms of May,
Farewell—I fly with love away!

I leave my parents here behind,

And all my friends—to love resigned—
*Tis grief to go, but death to stay :
Farewell—I’m gone with love away!
