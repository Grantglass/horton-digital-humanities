Or fiuitered o’er the purling brook at will, -
Sung in the dale or soar’d above the hill.
Such are the liberal charms of college life,
Where pleasure flows’ without a breeze of
strife;
And such would be my pain if cast away,
Without the blooms of study to display,
Beware, ye college birds, again beware,
And shun the fowler with his subtile snare;
Nor fall as one from Eden, stript of all
‘Phe life and beauty of your native hall;
Nor from the garden of your honor go,
Whence all the streams of fame and wisdom
flow;
Where brooding Milton’s theme aed sweet
along
With Pope upon the ci of epic song;
Where you may trace a bland Demosthenes,
Whose oratoric pen ne’er fails to please;
And Plato, with immortal Cicero, "
And with the eloquence of Horace glow;
There cull the dainties of a great Ainsworth,
Who sets the feast of ancient language forth;
Or glide with Ovid on his simple stream,
And catch the heat from Virgil's rural beam;
Through Addison you trace creation’s fire,
And all the rapid wheels of time admire;
