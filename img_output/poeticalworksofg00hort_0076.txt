. I shall not less thy grace adore,
So friend, forever fare thee well.

Farewell! forever, did [ say 2
What, never more thy face to see?
Then take the last fond look to-day,
And still to-morrow think of me.“

Farewell ! alas, the tragic sound ©
Has many a tender bosom torn;

While desolation spread around,
Deserted friendship left to mourn.

Farewell! awakes the sleeping tear,’

_ The dormant rill from sorrow’s eye,

Express’d from one by nature dear,
Whose bosom heaves the latent sigh.

Farewell ! is but departure’s tale,
When fond association ends,

And fate expands her lofty sail,
‘To show the distant flight of friends.

Alas! and if we sure must part, :
Far separated long to dwell, we
J leave thee with a broken heart,
So friend, forever, fare thee well.

T leave thee, but forget thee never,
Words cannot my feeling tell,
