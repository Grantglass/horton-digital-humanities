MAN A TORCH.

Blown up with painful care, and hard to light,
A glimmering torch, blown in a moment out;
Suspended by a webb, an angler’s bait,
Floating at stake along the stream of chance,
Snatch’d from its hook by the fish of poyerty.
A silent cavern is his last abode ;
The king’s repository, veil’d with gloom,
The umbrage of a thousand oziers ; bowed,
The couch of hallowed -bones, the slave’s asy-
lum,
The brave’s retreat, and end of ev’ry care.
