The day of separation is at hand ;"

Imagination lifts her gloomy curtains,

Like'ev’ning’s mantle: at the flight of day,

Thro’ which the trembling pinnacle we spy,

On which we soon ‘must ‘stand with hopeful
smiles, i

Or apprehending: frowns ; ‘to tumble on

The right or left forever.

PRIDE IN HEAVEN.

 

On heaven’s ethereal plain,
With hostile rage ambition first begun,
When the arch. rebel strove himself to reign
And take Jehovah’s throne.
Swift to the fight the seraphim
On floods of pride were seen to swim,
And bold defy the power supreme,
And thus their God disown.

High on a dome of state,
From azure fields he cast his. daring eye,
Licentious trains his magazines await,
At whose command they fly.
The gloom excludes celestial charms,
When all the angels rush to arms,
Heaven shakes beneath the vast alarms, _
And earth begins to sigh.
