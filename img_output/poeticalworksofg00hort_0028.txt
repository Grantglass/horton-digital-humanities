This place is a banquet ef glory,
Which rings with the ditties of May.

The chamber of Chatham and Dolly,
A place of a comical play,
Gave place unto Lovel’s fine folly,
The birds and sweet flowers of May.

Here Venus attends with her lover,
Here Floras their suitors betray,

And uncommon secrets discover,

. » Which break from the bosom of May.

Here ever young Hebe sits smiling,
The wonders of youth to portray,

Excluding old age from defiling
The lads and the lassies of May.

Call by, little stranger, one minute,
Your joy will reward your delay;

Come, feast with the lark and the linnet,
And drink of the waters of May.

Walk in, little mistress, be steady,
You ’r welcome a visit to pay;
All things in the chamber are ready,
Resolve to be married in May.
