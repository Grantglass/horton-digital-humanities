POEMS BY A SLAVE.

Sing, oh my soul, rise up and run,
And leave this clay behind;
Wing thy swift flight beyond the sun,
Nor dwell in tents confined.

eee

ON THE DEATH OF REBECCA.

Thou delicate blossom! thy short race is ended,
Thou sample of virtue and prize of the brave!
No more are thy beauties by mortals attended,
They now are but food for the worms and the grave.

Than art gone to the tomb, whence there’s no returning,
And left us behind in a vale of suspense ;

In vain to the dust do we follow thee mourning,
The same doleful trump will soon call us all hence.

I view thee now launched on eternity’s ocean,
Thy soul how it smiles as it floats on the wave;
It smiles as if filled with the softest emotion,
But looks not behind on the frowns of the grave.

The messenger came from afar to relieve thee—
In this lonesome valley no more shalt thou roam ;
Bright seraphs now stand on the banks to receive thee,
And ery, ‘Happy stranger, thou art welcome at home.””
Thou art gone to a feast, while thy friends are bewailing,
Oh, death is a song to the poor ransom’d slave ;
Away with bright visions the spirit goes sailing,
And leaves the frail body to rest in the grave.

Rebecca is free from the pains of oppression,

No friends could prevail with her longer to stay ;
She smiles on the fields of eternal fruition,

Whilst death like a bridegroom attends her away.

She is gone in the whirlwind—ye seraphs attend her,
Through Jordan’s cold torrent her mantle may lave ;

She soars in the chariot, and earth falls beneath her,
Resign’d in a shroud to a peaceable grave.
