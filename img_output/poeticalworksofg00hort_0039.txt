‘ 85

When nature seems to weep,
And life hangs trembling o’er the watery tomb,
Hope lifts her peaceful sail to brave the deep,
And bids me think of home.

My favorite pigeon rest,
Nor on the plane of sorrow drop thy train,
But on the bough of hope erect thy nest,
Tull friends shall meet again.

Though in the hermit’s cell, eS,
Where eager friends to cheer me fail to come,
Where Zeph’rus seems a joyless tale to tell,

No thought js sweet but home.

Inspires the present stream of song ;
A bonny belle,

When lads and lasses meet again;
But, bonny belle,
No long to dwell,
