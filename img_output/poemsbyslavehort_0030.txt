POEMS BY A SLAVE.

CONSEQUENCES OF HAPPY MARRIAGES.

Hail happy pair, from whom such raptures rise,
On whom I gaze with pleasure and surprise ;
From thy bright rays the gloom of strife is driven,
For all the smiles of mutual love are Heaven.

Thrice happy pair! no earthly joys excel °

Thy peaceful state; there constant pleasures dwell,
Which cheer the mind and elevate the soul,

Whilst discord sinks beneath their soft control.

The blaze of zeal extends from breast to breast,
While Heaven supplies each innocent request;
And lo! what fond regard their smiles reveal,
Attractive as the magnet to the steel.

Their peaceful life is all content and ease,
They with delight each other strive to please ;
Each other’s charms, they only can admire,
Whose bosoms burn with pure connubial fire.

Th’ indelible vestige of unblemished love,
Must hence a guide to generations prove :
Though virtuous partners moulder in the tomb,
Their light may shine on ages yet to come.

With grateful tears their well-spent day shall close,
When death, like evening, calls them to repose ;
Then mystic smiles may break from deep disguise,
Like Vesper’s torch transpiring in the skies.

Like constellations still their works may shine,
In virtue’s unextinguished blaze divine ;

Happy are they whose race shal] end the same—
Sweeter than odours is a virtuous name.

Such is the transcript of unfading grace,
Reflecting lustre on a future race,

The virtuous on this line delight to tread,
And magnify the honors of the dead—

Who like a Pheenix did not burn in vain,
Incinerated to revive again ;

From whose exalted urn young love shall rise,
Exulting from a funeral sacrifice.
