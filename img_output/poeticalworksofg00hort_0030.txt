Swiftly fly and weleome;

It is the fate of fools to rove ;
With whom I know
Wedlock is wo —

‘Without the stream of love:

Where constant love is wanting,
Pleasure has not long to dwell ;:
I view my fate,
Alas, too late !
So partner, fare thee well:

But, my love, remember,

Hence we meet and face to face,
Thy heart shall ache,
Thy soul shall quake,

The wretch of all disgrace.:

 

DEATH OF A FAVORITE CHAMBER MAID

O death, thy power I own,
Whose mission was to rush,
And snatch the rose, so quickly blown,
Down from its native bush;
The flower of beauty doom’d to pine,
Ascends from this to worlds divine.
