Rosabella—Purity of heart,

False Weight,

Departing Summer,

Reflections from the flash of a Meteor,
True Friendship,

On the Conversion of a Sister,

A Billet Doux, f

Troubled with the Itch,

Early Affection, i

The Creditor to his proud Debtor,
Regret for the Departure of Friends,
Farewell to Frances,

The Retreat from Moscow,
Imploring to be resigned at Death,
On the Pleasures of a College Life,
The graduate leaving College,
Division of an Estate,

Pride in Heaven,

To Miss Tempe,

Man a Torch, °
