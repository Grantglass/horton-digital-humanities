POEMS BY A SLAVE. 15

Lo, all the Southern windows close,
Whence spicy breezes roll ;

The herbage sinks in sad repose,
And Winter sweeps the whole.

Thus after youth old age comes on,
And brings the frost of time,

And e’er our vigour has withdrawn,
We shed the rose of prime.

Alas! how quick it is the case,
The scion youth is grown—

How soon it runs its morning race,
And beauty’s sun goes down.

The Autumn of declining years
Must blanch the father’s head,
Encumbered with a load of cares,
When youthful charms have fled.

HEAVENLY LOVE. \

Eternal spring of boundless grace,
It lifts the soul above,

Where God the Son unveils his face,
And shows that Heaven is love.

Love that revolves through endless years—
Love that can never pall;

Love which excludes the gloom of fears,
Love to whom God is all!

Love which can ransom every slave,
And set the pris’ner free ;

Gild the dark horrors of the grave,
And still the raging sea.

Let but the partial smile of Heaven
Upon the bosom play,

The mystic sound of sins forgiven,
Can waft the soul away.

The pilgrim’s spirits show this love,
They often soar on high;

Languish from this dim earth to move,
And leave the flesh to die.
