POEMS BY A SLAVE.

Responsive thunders roll,
Loud acclamations sound,

And show your Maker’s vast control
O’er all the worlds around.

Stupendous mountains smoke,
And lift your summits high,

To him who all your terrors woke,
Dark’ning the sapphire sky.

Now let my muse descend,
To view the march below—
Ye subterraneous worlds attend
And bid your chorus flow.

Ye vast volcanoes yell
Whence fiery cliffs are hurled;
And all ye liquid oceans swell
Beneath the solid world.

Ye cataracts combine,
Nor let the pean cease—
The universal concert join,
Thou dismal precipice.

But halt my feeble tongue,
My weary muse delays:

But, oh my soul, still float along
Upon the flood of praise!
