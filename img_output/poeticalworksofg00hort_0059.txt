Vain have I thought myself inspired,

Say, have 1 else but pain acquired?
Not ever, no, never!

No earthly geod, no stream of health, :
Flows from thy fount, thou cheerful giver;
From.thee, affluence sinks to stealth,
From thee I pluck no bloom of hezlth,
Whatever, no, never! .
‘Thou canst impart a noble mind,
Power from my tongue flows like a river;
The gas flows dead, I’m left behind,
‘To all that’s evil down confined;
To flourish more never!

With thee I must through life complain,
Thy powers at large will union sever;
